# Python-Programs
The Repository contain python Porject having some use in daily life
Each folder has several different csvs stored in it Comprising of similar headers or sometimes not.Suppose you want to combine similar format csv's to one.As in my case
the detection of first row as headers was neccessary.Because not all rows have header present at their first row.So my program will not iterate our those csv's.
Different csvs have different columns like emailaddress,mailaddress so detection of specific pattern was neccessary which i performed using regex.
As we are getting the same columns files as result so it becomes neccessary to save record of all such files in one place which my program is doing by saving those files
names and common columns along with them in txt format.
The program was created to automate a real life problem we were facing and can be changed or optimized according to your needs.
Thanks
